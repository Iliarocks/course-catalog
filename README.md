# ubcmatch.com

[ubcmatch.com](https://www.ubcmatch.com/) is an alternative course catalog for the University of British Columbia built using Next.js 15 and InstantDB.

## Why I'm making this
Currently, course selection at the University of British Columbia can feel fragmented and tedious. My aim is to make course selection an easier, more transparent, and more social task.

## What does it do
The site is still in its infancy, so right now all that's available is search, but the goal is add social features allowing users to favourite courses, see what courses their friends are taking, and provide easily accessible course information so students can make informed descisions on their future.
